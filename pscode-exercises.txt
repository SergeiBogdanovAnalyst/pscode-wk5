// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Input a number.
2. If the number is divisible by 2, it's even.
   Otherwise, it's odd.
3. Display the result.


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Read 5 numbers.
Create a variable sum = 0
Ask the user to input a number
Read a number
Add the input number to the variable sum
Repeat 5 times

b) Calculate their average.

Calculate average = sum / 5
Print average

c) Find the smallest and largest numbers.

Set the first entered number as both minimum and maximum values.
For each of the remaining 4 numbers: 
1. If the current number is less than min, update min to the current number
2. If the current number is greater than max, update max to the current number
3. Print min and max

d) Display the average, smallest, and largest numbers.

Print "The average of the five numbers is: "average"
Print "The smallest of the five numbers is: "min"
Print "The largest of the five numbers is: "max"
